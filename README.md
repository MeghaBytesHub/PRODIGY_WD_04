- **Responsive Navigation:** A user-friendly navigation menu that adapts to both desktop and mobile views.
- **Interactive Profile Section:** Includes my profile picture, a brief introduction, and links to my LinkedIn and GitHub profiles.
- **Detailed Experience and Projects Sections:** Highlights my experience and showcases my projects with smooth transitions and interactive elements.
- **Contact Section:** Easy-to-use contact links for getting in touch with me directly.
- **Downloadable CV:** Provides a button to download my resume directly from the website.

## Projects Section:

I have included a Projects section on my portfolio website to highlight the projects I'm currently working on and those I've completed. While the section is available, please note that the links to GitHub repositories or live demos are not yet provided.

I am actively working on these projects and will upload the relevant links soon to showcase my work in more detail. I appreciate your patience and understanding as I continue to update my portfolio.
